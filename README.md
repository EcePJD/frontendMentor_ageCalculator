## My process
FIrst, I properly organized the index.html contents to fit my envisioned html organization that is advantageous to the CSS approach I used after. As usual, I used flexBox CSS to easily organized the elements. Next, I added a false return callback to the onsubmit event of the form to prevent refresh / reload of the page. I attached the main function ( handles the verification of the date entered and the computation of the age ) as a callback in my submit button. After, is alot of formula tweaking that includes the leap years passed from the birthdate entered until now. I also incldued a notifier below the div on how many leap years a person encountered in his life until now.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- Javascript DOM

### What I learned
Since its been a year since I last programmed (because of WoRk), I was able to refresh a lot about the javascript DOM.
